               <h3>Why you should vote!</h3>
               <p> Participating in elections is one of the key freedoms of American life. Many people in countries around the world do not have the same freedom, nor did many Americans in centuries past. No matter what you believe or whom you support, it is important to exercise your rights.

               <h4>Check if your state allows early voting.</h4>
               <p>
                 Many states allow voters to cast their ballot before Election Day. Early voting is convenient because you may have more flexibility to work around your schedule and you're less likely to wait in line.

            <div>
               <h4>Learn where your polling place is. </h4>
              <p>
                 Polling places can be almost anywhere â€” government buildings, offices, schools, churches, restaurants, and sometimes even citizens' houses. In certain cities and counties, you may be able to choose which polling location you visit, but in most places you're required to vote at your assigned polling place. Make sure you know where it is and how to get there well before Election Day.                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
               <h4>Learn what's on your ballot.</h4>
               <p>
                 If you're new to voting, it may be a good idea to familiarize yourself with your local ballot. Each local ballot is a bit different. This will let you know exactly who is running for which office, and it will also spell out any referendum or initiatives appearing before the voters.
